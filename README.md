# LC-Overhaul

This mod changes a bit of gameplay.

## Installation

1. This mod requires BepInEx modloader, you can get [here](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/).
2. Simply just drag and drop the "ModRush_Overhaul-*version*.dll" from the zip inside your *"Lethal Company/BedInEx/plugins"* folder.
3. Enjoy! üòÅ

To configure some settings, open the config file located in *"Lethal Company/BedInEx/config/ModRush.Patcher.cfg"*.

## Currently there are these features in this mod

- New terminal commands `curval` and `quota`

***Configurable features*** :
- Open doors by just tapping **E**
- Batteries have more capacity
- Inverse Teleporter does not drop your items
- Optimized stamina
- Scrap will not be lost when all die (Unless you're fired)
- Drop-ship arrives faster
- The day is longer but also **can** be more dangerous

*Note: Most of these configurable features have fixed values, to not unbalance the game. You just decide if you want to enable it or not. Also some values are disabled by default. So check the config file.*
